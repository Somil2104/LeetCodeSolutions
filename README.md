# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). I am uploading my code solutions along with explanations (where necessary) to help others understand different problem-solving approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Structure
Each problem solution is organized in a separate folder containing a README file with the problem statement and a corresponding solution file. The folder structure follows:
```
ðŸ“‚ LeetCode-Solutions
â”‚-- ðŸ“‚ Problem-Name
â”‚   â”‚-- README.md (Contains problem statement)
â”‚   â”‚-- solution.py (Contains the solution)
â”‚-- README.md
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository
- Browse the repository and pick problems based on difficulty or topic.
- Each problem folder contains:
  - A `README.md` file with the problem statement.
  - A `solution.py` file with an optimized solution and comments.
  - Alternative approaches (if applicable).

## ðŸ›  Languages Used
I primarily solve problems in **Python**, but may also include solutions in **C++** or **Java** occasionally.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Many more...

## ðŸ’¡ Contribution
If you have suggestions for improvement or better solutions, feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request**!



Happy Coding! ðŸš€
